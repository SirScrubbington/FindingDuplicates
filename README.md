## Description
Repository for the game Finding Duplicates, a simple game for finding duplicate numbers 
written using the Python command line. This application was developed as the first 10%
assignment for 2801ICT Computing Algorithms, which I took during my second semester 
of University in 2017. 

This is a legacy repository, and will no longer be updated or maintained.
